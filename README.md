# Missile Defense
- Game for google chrome browers written in HMTL5

# Gameplay
- The player controls one circle with the arrow keys that allows them to block incoming missiles from the enemy, while the cursor
controls where the player will fire their own missiles at the enemy. Each player's country is set up into different sectors meaning
that one can be lost without losing the whole game. However, losing a sector hurts the player in some way based on what that sector did
for the player's country.


# Current Status
- Game is in a very early stage (aka no where close to complete)

# Current Bugs

#Future Additions
- Ability to control how the country is set up into sectors rather than randomly generated
